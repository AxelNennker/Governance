PURPOSE:
--------

The development of open, global, and interoperable API solutions
could benefit customers and developer ecosystems by giving access
to operator capabilities in whatever network customers are in
and therefore allow applications to run consistently between
telco networks and countries. A new form of collaboration between
various players (telcos, ISVs, device manufacturers, hyperscalers, etc.)
could address much of the challenges in scaling API services across
heterogenous operator architectures as well as advance the connectivity
industry towards a more robust and faster core network, encourage the faster
adoption of capabilities and as a result create value for the entire tech industry.

The repository will mainly include service api specification files, 
service API code and alliance documentation (see: documentation). It will 
also include architecture guidelines for exposing service APIs.
