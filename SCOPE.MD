## Functional scope:
From functional perspective the scope is limited to telco APIs, that means APIs in the domain of telco mobile networks, telco fixed line networks or supporting these (e.g. for authentication). The respective API families are clarified during the ramp up of the Telco Global API project, specifically the ones exposed to customers.

## Technical scope:
Technically the scope is about northbound Service APIs, that means an abstraction / aggregation of e.g. 3GPP APIs or TM Forum APIs to hide telco complexity, keep control at the operator side and fulfill regulatory and data privacy constraints. Optionally in scope are east-/westbound APIs on the same abstraction / aggregation level.

## Service scope:
- Collect API requirements from GSMA OPG subgroup and other sources
- Specify service APIs and create test cases from business/customer perspective
- Implement service APIs (Reference Implementation)
- Create and perform Test Cases from Developer perspective (to show that the Service API has been implemented correctly)
- Create documentation for service APIs
- Test service APIs from business/customer perspective in telco network(s)
- Create reference architecture (if possible preferred solution is to refer to an existing architecture, see GitHub issue #7)

## Deliverables:
- Service API code and documentation
- Test cases and tools
- Reference architecture
