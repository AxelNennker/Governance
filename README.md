## Mission statement

4G/5G network capabilities exposed through APIs provide a large benefit for customers. By hiding telco complexity behind APIs and making the APIs available across telco networks and countries, CAMARA enables an easy and seamless access.

## Project Charter

The Project description and scope, governance, voting rules, IPRs and policies of the CAMARA Project are documented in the [Project Charter](./ProjectCharter.md).
The Project structure and roles are documented in the [Project Structure And Roles](./ProjectStructureAndRoles.md).

## Code of Conduct

This Project has adopted the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) in version 2.0 as our code of conduct. Please see the details in our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). All contributors must abide by the code of conduct.

## Working Language

We decided to apply _English_ as the primary project language.  

Consequently, all content will be made available primarily in English. We also ask all interested people to use English as language to create issues, in their code (comments, documentation etc.) and when you send requests to us. The APIs itself and all end-user facing content will be made available in other languages as needed.
