The goal of this project is to develop open, global, and interoperable API solutions to benefit customers and developer ecosystems by giving access to operator capabilities in whatever network customers are in and therefore allow applications to run consistently between telco networks and countries.

A new form of collaboration between various players (telcos, ISVs,
device manufacturers, hyperscalers, etc.) could address much of the challenges in scaling API services across heterogenous operator architectures as well as advance the connectivity industry towards a more robust and faster core network, encourage the faster adoption of capabilities and as a result create value for the entire tech industry.

So, the main purpose of the project is to
* Standardize and promote Service APIs
* Accelerate technology development
* Accelerate commercial adoption
