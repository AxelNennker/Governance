Points from QOD Working group | &nbsp; |  • Should tools for telemetry/scheduling/performance characterizations be based on a technology like Kubernetes? <br/> • Use of Intel's OpeNESS platform
Q&A / AOB	| &nbsp; | 1. Can we park the questions for telemerty & technology related tools for next call? <br/> Yes we can park this until the main scope decision made tomorrow <br/>2. If implementation is part of project scope, would it make sense to have a common platform/portal to publish/discover and test and validate the APIs.<br/> Telefonica suggest offering such a platform instance for the dedicated use of this project.
