Recap | During the last meeting an update of the Quality on Demand APIs have been announced. <br/> The API specs have been published last week. Last meeting's presentation slides have been published at https://github.com/camaraproject/rep_main/blob/main/APIs/QualityOnDemand/documentation/Presentations/QoD-API_Alliance.pdf
Update on API specs | •  The updated API specs are now available at https://github.com/camaraproject/rep_main/tree/main/APIs/QualityOnDemand <br/> •  The specs version is now "stable": it won't be altered within the next 2 months to provide a stable basis for initial testing by developers. <br/> •  All feedback, comments and proposals are welcome!
Q&A | • **Why two similar separate APIs have been created instead of a single one with two features?** <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; We wanted to make things as simple as possible. Although (in fact) currently there is just one common testing API behind, in the future the two QoD may diverge significantly, thus it has been decided to keep them separated. Still, this may be revised later on in further development.

## Request to participants
 • **Any feedback on the current API specs will be appreciated, thank you!** <br/>
