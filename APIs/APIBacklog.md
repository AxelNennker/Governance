| API family  | Tags (ITU-T / TM Forum) |  Partner who intends to contribute | Description of API family | Supporting network capabilities | Availability | Relevance | Priority | 
| -----------------------| --------- | ------------ | -------- |----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------|
| Quality on demand || DT + TELUS |It provides the customer with the ability to: <ul><li>set quality for a mobile connection (e.g. required latency, jitter, bit rate).</li><li>get notification if network cannot fulfill.</li></ul>*NOTE: The scope of this API family should be limited (at least at a first stage) to 4G and 5G*.| ||||
| Device configuration ||| It provides the customer with the ability to register an IoT device and update device subscription |||| 
| Accounting, Charging and Billing |||It provides the customer with the ability to:<ul><li>get information about the usage of the services and components that can be charged for (e.g. changes for QoS during each session lifetime)</li><li>get information about actual cost for API usage</li></ul>*NOTE: This culd be transversal to the functional (service) APIs, and apply to all of them*.|||||
| Baseline OAM ||| It provides the customer with the ability to:<ul><li>consume management data, including business related data (e.g., SLA, subscriber data, customer profile), and operation related data (e.g. PM/FM data, logs, trace, analytics reports, event notifications).</li></ul>*NOTE: The management data feeds customer owned systems, and can be used for internal consumption (B2B) or made available to their own customers (B2B2X, e.g. hyperscaler enriches management data with additional information, and exposes them to their own customers via proprietary APIs)*.<br></br><ul><li>gain access to Customer-Facing Service (CFS) catalog and inventory</li></ul> |||||
| Advanced OAM ||| It provides the customer the ability to trigger day-2 activities, e.g. scaling in/out, policy injection for data collection, etc.<br></br>*NOTE: The operator always acts on behalf of the customer (customer is not granted with direct access to operator OSS capabilities)*.  |||||
| Device status ||| It provides the customer with the ability to receive information about device status.<br></br>*NOTE 1: The customer can explicitly query for this information (request-response mode) or be reported with notifications on subscribed events (subscribe-notify mode)*.<br></br>*NOTE 2: Examples of this info include e.g., location tracking (UE location and cell site), USIM change,  no. devices present in an area (RA, TA, cell), device mobility info (intra-TA handover, inter-TA handover),  CN type change (5G to 4G, viceversa), roaming status, device reachability (e.g. for SMS delivery)*.
| Network status status ||| It provides the customer with the ability to receive information about network status.<br></br>*NOTE 1: The customer can explicitly query for this information (request-response mode) or be reported with notifications on subscribed events (subscribe-notify mode)*.<br></br>*NOTE 2: Examples of this info include e.g., network connectivity type (no connectivity, 4G, 5G, ..),  performance measurements (e.g. UL/throughput, latency, jitter, packet loss rate, etc.), fault events (e.g. network congestions, node failure).* <br></br>*NOTE 3: Performance measurements and fault events can be provided at network node (function) level,  network domain (slice subnet) or end-to-end (slice) level*. |||||
| Edge Discovery ||| TBD |||||
| Edge Discovery ||| It provides the customer with the ability to:<ul><li>Discover the set of edge nodes available in a certain region, where the customer can deploy edge applications</li><li>discover the set of edge nodes in a certain region where a certain API functionality is available (and thus the customer edge application can make use of it). </li></ul>*NOTE: Applicable at provisioning time. Note that there can be a mode in which the customer does not know about the actual edge nodes and can just ask for the deployment of an edge app to cover a certain region (the provider decides which edge nodes will be needed)*.<br></br><ul><li>request the edge service instance to connect to for a certain user/device, based on its location and app requirements. This includes edge application discovery (mandatory) and edge application relocation (optional, in mobility scenarios for service contuinity support).</li></ul>*NOTE: Applicable at operation time*. |||||
| Traffic Influence |||It provides the customer with the ability to modify the connection policies of UEs and applications in terms of how the traffic flows (QoS and routing).<br></br>*NOTE: wrt QoS, the customer can request for a specific 5QI on the session*.<br></br>*NOTE: wrt routing, the customer can specify the edge node towards which traffic shall be routed*. |||||
